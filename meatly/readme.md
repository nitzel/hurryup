# timeline (GMT+1)
- 16:00 uff, exam is over! Lets get home.
- 17:00 meatlyjam starts! My first gamejam!!! Wuhu :banana:
- 18:02 using [nitzel.github.io](http://nitzel.github.io "this is a link you can click") to present this. quite a cool thing, this github.io
- 18:36 oh my, time flies. where did these 96minutes go? But I got a simple Idea. *Just make something*, right? This will be **awesome**.
- 19:13 downloaded phaser.js - how does it work?
- 20:23 finished phaser.js tutorial. **not too confident**
- 00:06 ate, played around with phaser examples and founda googlefont which is okay. not good, but okay. its free :) there is another one that looks better, but its not free :(
- 07:48 up again and ready to rumble.
- 11:56 shadow and sound added
- 12:00 17hours are gone. forever! :( And I still need to dig more into this **phaser** framework thing.
- 12:32 equal speed in all directions when walking
- 13:30 new ideas regarding intro :)
- 13:45 camera targets player, fixed texts
- 14:56 colored text :) that linebreak-thing took me a while...
- 15:04 that linebreak-thing is still not working completely! GNAH!
- 15:10 got'cha! finally
- 17:00 Half the time's over! 24h left **gogogo**
- 17:29 Uff finally shadowed objects get created correctly! that was not too easy. Why does PHASER have to scale the width/height of a bounding box, but NOT the offset??? **todo** report as maybe-bug
- 17:40 Fixed background
- 19:26 Added some sounds, fairy and nintendo
- 21:04 cooked some nice meal. no idea how i get a simple z-order for my sprites yet :(
- 22:29 looked for some music, didnt find any. Added some sounds and the downfish. Entities are now grouped, maybe I can do sth about the visibility/zorder
- 23:47 not productive ... failed at loading screen xD
- 00:01 gotta get some sleep. tomorrow there are still around 10hrs to do it!
